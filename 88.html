<meta name="Description" content="Bloxorz is a free puzzle game. All that we ask is that you help us maintain order. A square peg into a square hole. It's simple. Geometric shapes and their ability to interlock are the basic building blocks of order. If we can't move them around and drop them into place, we have anarchy. We don't want anarchy. We don't want our shapes walking all willy nilly off the sides of platforms, beyond the edge of the grid, or into the oblivion of the unknown beneath it. There is a certain beauty in order and an undeniable deformity in chaos. An ugly, insidious aesthetic which robs the natural world of its god-given balance and beauty. And all that we ask is that you help us maintain order That you help us keep the world beautiful, that you keep the square pegs snugly in their square holes. This is done for you, for me, and for thee betterment of the world.. Only found on FLASHGAMESS.com">

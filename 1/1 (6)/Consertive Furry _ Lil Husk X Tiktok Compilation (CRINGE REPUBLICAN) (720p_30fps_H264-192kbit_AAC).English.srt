guys little husk here and welcome to a

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:08,638
cringy tech talk video

3
00:00:05,519 --> 00:00:09,759
i set up this account just a couple days

4
00:00:08,638 --> 00:00:11,039
ago

5
00:00:09,759 --> 00:00:13,359
it's going to be absolutely

6
00:00:11,039 --> 00:00:14,959
cringe-worthy and

7
00:00:13,359 --> 00:00:16,960
i just wanted to make this video to

8
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:20,400
introduce myself

9
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:22,400
but i also wanted to say that you know

10
00:00:20,399 --> 00:00:24,479
people have been telling me that i've

11
00:00:22,399 --> 00:00:26,799
been cute

12
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:28,080
i'm here to dispute with that fiction

13
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:31,199
what the [ __ ] is so

14
00:00:28,079 --> 00:00:33,759
cute about this [ __ ] nothing

15
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:35,920
i'm [ __ ] disgusting i'm sorry it's

16
00:00:33,759 --> 00:00:38,640
just the truth

17
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:39,920
okay you can do a lot better than my

18
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:43,439
[ __ ] ass okay

19
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:44,960
that's the fact hey guys

20
00:00:43,439 --> 00:00:46,079
little husk here and welcome back to

21
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:46,960
another video today we're going to be

22
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:49,520
talking about why

23
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:52,239
the entirety of the school system and

24
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:55,760
education in itself is [ __ ]

25
00:00:52,238 --> 00:00:58,320
the reason why is because education

26
00:00:55,759 --> 00:00:59,920
learning is learning new information

27
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:02,558
that you didn't know before

28
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:04,478
not taking some tests based on things

29
00:01:02,558 --> 00:01:07,039
you've already learned

30
00:01:04,478 --> 00:01:08,319
okay that's just called copying that's

31
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:10,560
as simple as that

32
00:01:08,319 --> 00:01:12,000
guys chelsea here and welcome back to

33
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:16,159
another video today we're going to be

34
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:18,640
disproving veganism as an idea

35
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:19,359
so veganism is stupid for multiple

36
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:21,200
reasons

37
00:01:19,359 --> 00:01:23,438
number one because the human body needs

38
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:26,879
a balance of both meats and vegetables

39
00:01:23,438 --> 00:01:29,359
number two these animals are

40
00:01:26,879 --> 00:01:30,478
already being killed so why are you not

41
00:01:29,359 --> 00:01:32,478
eating the meat

42
00:01:30,478 --> 00:01:34,799
yes it is a problem if more animals are

43
00:01:32,478 --> 00:01:36,319
being killed than are being produced

44
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:38,159
but what's not a problem is eating

45
00:01:36,319 --> 00:01:40,078
animals at all because these are already

46
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:41,680
dead so i don't get why you're not doing

47
00:01:40,078 --> 00:01:42,959
it especially if it's good for your body

48
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:44,560
to balance out the meats and the

49
00:01:42,959 --> 00:01:46,078
vegetables thank you very much have a

50
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:50,240
good day

51
00:01:46,078 --> 00:01:52,158
today was crazy so i wake up

52
00:01:50,239 --> 00:01:54,319
and i'm thinking today's gonna be a good

53
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:57,680
day and i was

54
00:01:54,319 --> 00:02:00,239
gonna you know apply for a job today

55
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:02,079
so that's what i was gonna do so i was

56
00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:05,280
like all right

57
00:02:02,078 --> 00:02:08,159
and so i start the day by trying to go

58
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:09,439
under my bed just to like kind of clear

59
00:02:08,159 --> 00:02:11,038
it out a little bit

60
00:02:09,439 --> 00:02:13,280
and then the exercise machine that i

61
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:15,039
have against my wall nearly falls on me

62
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:16,479
and pretty much nearly crushed me to

63
00:02:15,039 --> 00:02:18,479
death

64
00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:20,238
the next part is i basically grab

65
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:22,639
everything i need to go

66
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:24,000
i go outside i'm looking on google maps

67
00:02:22,639 --> 00:02:27,598
on my phone

68
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,520
and i'm walking through 90 degree heat

69
00:02:27,598 --> 00:02:30,878
my feet are starting to hurt and i'm

70
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:34,239
sweating like

71
00:02:30,878 --> 00:02:37,199
absolute madness and i was pushing

72
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:39,439
further and further to my destination

73
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:41,119
and i felt like i was literally dying

74
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:44,079
literally by the time i got back

75
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:44,719
to my house my heart was beating so fast

76
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:48,160
i could swear

77
00:02:44,719 --> 00:02:49,519
that i was dying hey guys husk here with

78
00:02:48,159 --> 00:02:50,639
another video

79
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:53,039
and today we're going to talk about the

80
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:55,439
lgbtqia plus community and what i have

81
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:56,639
problems with them for number one is

82
00:02:55,439 --> 00:02:58,479
definitely the flag

83
00:02:56,639 --> 00:03:00,479
i don't get why they have to fly a flag

84
00:02:58,479 --> 00:03:02,878
just because they think they're special

85
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:04,959
they're not special at all it's like if

86
00:03:02,878 --> 00:03:06,959
i were a conservative or a liberal

87
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:08,560
according to political ideology i

88
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:11,598
wouldn't fly the flag

89
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:14,878
that'd be stupid as hell so

90
00:03:11,598 --> 00:03:18,399
imagine you're me and you walk

91
00:03:14,878 --> 00:03:22,479
to work look at this this

92
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:22,480
in the middle of the goddamn river

93
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:27,039
in the middle of the goddamn river

94
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:35,200
like what the [ __ ] am i supposed to do

95
00:03:33,439 --> 00:03:37,280
jump in the [ __ ] middle of the river

96
00:03:35,199 --> 00:03:38,560
that's where that's that's interesting i

97
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:43,759
didn't know i was a [ __ ]

98
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:45,759
fish my final problem with the lgbtqia

99
00:03:43,759 --> 00:03:47,359
plus community is that encourages hate

100
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:50,639
against straight people

101
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:52,959
specifically in the community it has

102
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:55,598
everything it has asexuals it has

103
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:57,840
transgenders it has

104
00:03:55,598 --> 00:03:59,438
people that don't identify as anything

105
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,360
non-binary

106
00:03:59,438 --> 00:04:02,799
but you'll notice that they don't

107
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:04,400
include straight in there why

108
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:06,159
because it's not a community of

109
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:07,438
acceptance if it was it would have

110
00:04:06,158 --> 00:04:09,359
straight people in it

111
00:04:07,438 --> 00:04:11,919
think about that it's a community of

112
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:13,599
hate against straight people

113
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:15,119
hey guys welcome back to another

114
00:04:13,598 --> 00:04:18,478
[ __ ] video

115
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:20,399
i'm little husk my second video on the

116
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:23,599
lgbt community was removed

117
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:26,799
for pointing out a definition on google

118
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:27,360
i said that another problem i had was

119
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:30,800
that

120
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:34,080
if you look up the word gender dysphoria

121
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:35,918
on google and you specifically read the

122
00:04:34,079 --> 00:04:37,918
definition it says

123
00:04:35,918 --> 00:04:39,918
gender dysphoria is a condition where a

124
00:04:37,918 --> 00:04:41,519
person experiences discomfort or

125
00:04:39,918 --> 00:04:43,599
distress because there's a mismatch

126
00:04:41,519 --> 00:04:44,799
between their biological sex and gender

127
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:47,199
identity

128
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:48,639
this is known as gender identity

129
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:51,040
disorder

130
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:53,360
gender incongruence or transgenderism

131
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:55,680
it's literally a mental illness

132
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:57,360
and for pointing out that fact and

133
00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:00,478
something you can search up

134
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:01,600
i was unrightfully censored because

135
00:05:00,478 --> 00:05:04,000
these people

136
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:05,120
are so [ __ ] trigger-happy that oh

137
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,839
we're just gonna censor

138
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:10,959
anything anti-lgbt these people are

139
00:05:07,839 --> 00:05:12,799
pushing mental illness for god's sake

140
00:05:10,959 --> 00:05:15,198
this video is a response to the trump

141
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:18,639
song and the idiot who made it

142
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:21,360
biden is a [ __ ] fake ass catholic

143
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:22,560
he lied about his religion just like his

144
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:25,600
mental state

145
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:26,399

00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:33,439

00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:38,080
his rallies were as small as his brain

151
00:05:36,839 --> 00:05:42,159
capacity

00:05:38,079 --> 00:05:44,079

i'd rather be

191
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:15,280
directly the words i would sing to you

192
00:07:15,439 --> 00:07:23,038
and i don't do this [ __ ] for anybody

193
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:26,639
because number one i'm cringy as [ __ ]

194
00:07:23,038 --> 00:07:28,639
and number two you're the only person i

195
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:32,160
care about enough

196
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:34,079
to do this for okay

197
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,360
i literally spent the last couple

198
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:38,079
minutes

199
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:40,400
practicing because that's how bad i am

200
00:07:38,079 --> 00:07:40,399
at this

201
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:44,399
if you think you're anywhere half as bad

202
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:47,440
as me

203
00:07:44,399 --> 00:07:50,560
you gotta be joking me

204
00:07:47,439 --> 00:07:53,680
i'm annoying cringy

205
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:57,038
fat and

206
00:07:53,680 --> 00:08:02,720
i have asthma and i'm autistic

207
00:07:57,038 --> 00:08:02,719
give me a [ __ ] break give me a break

208
00:08:02,959 --> 00:08:08,000
and every time you say that nonsense you

209
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:11,519
know what my response is every time

210
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:14,560
you're perfect the way you are because

211
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:18,000
when you say these things about yourself

212
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:20,079
i immediately am ready to counteract you

213
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,240
every time you have to go here's

214
00:08:20,079 --> 00:08:25,758
directly what i say

215
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:29,280
here is exactly the line i said to you

216
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:31,038
yesterday at 2 35 pm on discord

217
00:08:29,279 --> 00:08:34,799
no matter how many times i get beaten

218
00:08:31,038 --> 00:08:34,799
down or how much it feels like things go

219
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:43,680
wrong

220
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:43,680
you

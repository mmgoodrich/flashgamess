or hot cocoa that only seems to do the

19
00:01:00,558 --> 00:01:04,399
trick when you're having

20
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:04,399
trouble sleeping

55
00:03:02,318 --> 00:03:05,839
take

56
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:05,839
you to a doctor

well i i don't know

58
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:16,560

59
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:19,120
pills or send you to a sleep clinic

60
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:20,000
but if there are remedies we can try

61
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:23,200

62
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,199
shot right

00:03:26,878 --> 00:03:32,639

from your mind

procrastinate a lot

125
00:07:05,279 --> 00:07:09,439
but that's okay because it's part of who

00:07:15,038 --> 00:07:21,680
your mistakes and shortcomings

130
00:07:18,399 --> 00:07:28,000

the knowledge and maturity you hold

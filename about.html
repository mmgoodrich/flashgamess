<h1>About</h1>
    <p>
    Welcome to Flashmath1, your number one source for the best flash and html5 games.<br>
    We're dedicated to giving you the very best entertainment. Founded in 2018 by <br>
    Isaac Beverly, Flashmath1 has come a long way from its beginnings as a small game<br>
    collection for the owner. When Beverly first started out, providing the best web <br>
    games for his friends, he developed a hobby in collecting and sharing his games <br>
    for everyone on the web.  We now serve players all over the world, and are <br>
    thrilled to be a part of the free browser game wing of the gaming industry. We <br>
    hope you enjoy our games as much as we enjoy offering them to you. If you have <br>
    any questions or comments, please don't hesitate to contact us.<br>
<br>
    Sincerely,<br>
    Isaac Beverly, Founder

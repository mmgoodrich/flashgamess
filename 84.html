<meta name="Description" content="The Worlds Hardest Game is sincerely the worlds hardest game. Strategize, execute, and overcome! In these action puzzlers, you'll be in charge of steering your green square through level after level or blue dots and red zones. Your goal is really quite simple: avoid the blue dots and navigate yourself from one red zone to another. That is it, that is all that is expected of you, sounds simple does it not? Well, it's not. It's actually hard. In fact, some have said this is the worlds hardest game --and it is. You'll have to match your dexterity to your ability to solve puzzles as you traverse these levels. Avoiding blue balls is a lot easier than it sounds. You'll see, you'll all see., only found on FLASHGAMESS.com">
